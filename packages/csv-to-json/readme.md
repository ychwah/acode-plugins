# CSV to JSON

CSV to JSON conversion transforms plain text tabular data into a more organized and readable JSON structure, making it ideal for web development, data analysis, and interoperability between different systems. 

In any CSV file, use the command &quot;*CSV to JSON*&quot; in command palette (*Ctrl + Shift + p*), which will generate a new JSON file in your workspace.
